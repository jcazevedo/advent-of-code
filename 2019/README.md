# Advent of Code 2019 solutions

My solutions for [Advent of Code 2019][adventofcode2019], in C++.

## Instructions

You can compile the programs to solve all days by issuing the following command:

    $ make

If you want to compile the program for a specific day, issue the following
command, replacing `XX` with the desired day:

    $ make dayXX

The previous command produces a `dayXX` binary. Unless stated otherwise, every
problem reads its input from the corresponding `dayXX.in` file and writes to the
standard output.
