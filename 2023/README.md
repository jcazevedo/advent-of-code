# Advent of Code 2023 solutions

My solutions to [Advent of Code 2023][adventofcode2023], in C++.

## Instructions

You can compile the programs to solve all days by issuing the following command:

    $ make

If you want to compile the program for a specific day, issue the following
command, replacing `XX` with the desired day:

    $ make dayXX

The previous command produces a `dayXX` binary. Unless stated otherwise, every
problem reads its input from the corresponding `input/dayXX.in` file and writes
to the standard output.
